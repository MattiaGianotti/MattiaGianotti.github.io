        <p>
          During all these years of research I have collected a number of pubblications on scientific conferences, scientific journals, and books.
          In this page organize my research based on topics for an easier discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best part of the researcher's work is to be able to share its results with the rest of the scientific community. Writing papers for
          the most prominent venues (be it journals or conferences) and being able to participate in this events, meet other researchers and share ideas, 
          opinions, point of view and aims had given me a huge boost in my research activities, and I still hope to be able to continue doing so. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have collecred here my ublication until 2024, but for more detials and more recent updates, please refers to my research social pages:

                    <p class="abstract">Interactive Multi-Sensory Environments (iMSEs) are room-sized interactive installations equipped with digitally enriched physical 
                      materials and ambient embedded devices. These items can sense users' presence, gestures, movements, and manipulation, and react by providing gentle 
                      stimulation (e.g., light, sound, projections, blowing bubbles, tactile feel, aromas) to different senses. Most of prior research on iMSEs investigates 
                      their use for persons with disabilities (e.g., autism). Our work focuses on the use of iMSEs in primary education contexts and for mixed groups of 
                      young students, i.e., children with and without disability. The paper describes the latest version of an iMSE called Magic Room that has been installed 
                      in two local schools. We report two empirical studies devoted to understand how the Magic Room could be used in inclusive educational settings, and to 
                      explore its potential benefits.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">Magika is an interactive Multisensory Environment that enables new forms of playful interventions for children, especially 
                      those with Special Education Needs. Designed in cooperation with more than 30 specialists at local care centers and primary schools, Magika 
                      integrates digital worlds projected on the wall and the floor with a gamut of "smart" physical objects (toys, ambient lights, materials, and 
                      various connected appliances) to enable tactile, auditory, visual, and olfactory stimuli. The room is connected with an interface for educators 
                      that enables them to: control the level of stimuli and their progression; define and share a countless number of game-based learning activities; 
                      customize such activities to the evolving needs of each child. This paper describes Magika and discusses its potential benefits for play, 
                      education and inclusion.</p>

                      such as Intellectual Disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down Syndrome, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The paper describes 
                      an IoT empowered physical space called “Magic Room” that supports interaction with “smart” objects and the entire space through body motion 
                      and objet manipulation, provides different combination of stimuli. The Magic Room has been designed in collaboration with NDD experts from a 
                      local care centre and and, providing an open set of multimodal multisensory activities for children with NDD that stimulate the visual, aural, 
                      tactile, olfactory and motor system, may pave the ground towards new forms of intervention for this target group. The technology beneath the 
                      Magic Room is an extensible multi-layered software and hardware platform to connect and manage different devices. Activities executed into this 
                      Multisensory Environment (MSE) are completely customizable for each child by the therapist.</p>

                      Ahù has a combination of features that make it unique to the current available multisensory technologies for learning: it has a 
                      totem shape, supports multimedia stimuli by communicating through voice, lights and multimedia contents projected on two different 
                      fields on the floor and allows cooperative and competitive games. The system is nomadic, so it can be moved around, and can be controlled 
                      with easy input methods. An exploratory study investigates and provides Ahù's potential to promote engagement, collaboration, socialization 
                      and learning in classrooms.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the creation of Interactive Smart Spaces (ISSs) where different types of digital 
                      devices are integrated in the ambient or embedded in physical objects, and can sense human actions to control equipment, modify environmental 
                      parameters, or create multi-sensory effects. These IoT-enhanced interactive systems can support human activities in different contexts, 
                      e.g., education, entertainment, home assistance, rehabilitation, to name a few. This paper explores a human-centered perspective in the design 
                      of ISSs, which takes into account some salient characteristics of these systems and introduces new conceptual modeling issues going beyond 
                      representing hardware, software, and connectivity features of IoT devices. Interaction in particular emerges as a crucial modeling dimension, 
                      needed to capture the interplay occurring not only among multiple connected IoT devices but also among the users and the materials or the 
                      spaces embedding such devices. The paper presents a novel conceptual model for Interactive Smart Spaces and exemplifies the identified 
                      abstractions through a case study, modelling a complex ISS for children' play and learning that has been installed at two local schools and 
                      two therapeutic centers in our country.</p>

                      Each student has different skills, aptitudes and difficulties, and the learning process requires more or less time in relation to both the 
                      topic to assimilate and the employed teaching method. Our system, called Magika, is a multi-modal and multi-sensory environment that empowers 
                      teachers and aims at providing students with the right learning supports. Magika includes a preliminary phase called "on-boarding", aimed at 
                      defining their likes and dislikes, and an intelligent engine, "Geniel", capable of discerning and suggesting the most suitable activities to 
                      be played, according to the player's profile.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">Measuring cognitive functions is a complex and challenging process, and researchers usually conduct their study in 
                      experimental settings and with standardized tests. Such an approach is raising more and more criticism. Especially about the capability 
                      of psychology's laboratory experiments to provide generalizable and accurate indicators of impairments outside the laboratory boundaries 
                      in everyday life. This is acknowledged as the ”real-world or lab” dilemma. Most tests traditionally performed using paper-and-pencil may 
                      fail to detect the individual's difficulties in the real world. The scientific community has launched a quest for new digitized, interactive, 
                      and more ”ecological” versions. Our work investigates a novel approach to this topic that exploits interactive Multi-Sensory Environments 
                      (iMSE) and questions how iMSEs could contribute to the neuropsychology assessment field. The paper describes NEP-Neuro-Psychological Suite, 
                      a set of game-based activities in iMSE inspired by widely adopted neuropsychological tests. The suite provides a context in which existing 
                      or new neuropsychological tests can be experimented, extended, and modified with stimuli, contents, and tasks closer to real-world situations. 
                      We report an exploratory empirical study (N=22) on a well-known test to assess attention skills, the Stroop Test. The results, although very 
                      preliminary, provide insights into the effects of transposing classic tests into a novel form and the role that iMSEs can play in the debate 
                      about the ”real-world or lab” dilemma.</p>

                      Painting and music therapy approaches can help to foster social interaction for autistic people. However, the tools sometimes lack of 
                      flexibility and fail to keep people's attention. Unknowns also remain about the effect of combining these approaches. Though, very few 
                      studies have investigated how Multisensory Environments (MSEs) could help to address these issues. This paper presents the design of a 
                      full-body music and painting activity called “MusicTraces” which aims to foster collaboration between people with moderate to severe 
                      learning disabilities and complex needs, and in particular autism, within an MSE. The co-design process with caregivers and people with 
                      neurodevelopmental conditions is detailed, including a workshop, the initial design, remote iterations, and a design critique.</p>

                      Multisensory environments (MSEs) as an educational platform for fostering the improvement of various skills of children with autism spectrum 
                      disorder (ASD). In this paper, we explored the beliefs and experiences of practitioners in promoting creativity for children with autism in MSEs.
                       We transformed collected data into the guidelines for teachers and developers to facilitate free exploration. Guidelines include the 
                       practitioner's definition of the open-ended game framework and game structure elements that encourage co-construction and free exploration of 
                       typically and atypically developing children. To explore the relevance of these guidelines, designers and engineers from our Lab created a 
                       new game in Multisensory environments, Magic Room. Game “Explora!” is a highly interactive and immersive experience for the Magic Room, catered 
                       toward atypical and typical children aged 6-12 years old to develop their explorative, collaborative, and communication skills.</p>

                      This paper examines the influence of the Interactive Multisensory Environment (iMSE) on the training of deaf children in comparison to 
                      traditional methods. Over a 7-week duration, two groups of deaf children were evaluated and trained, one utilizing the iMSE (Experimental Group) 
                      and the other employing a traditional PC-based method (Control Group). The training encompassed four different thematic categories, each with 
                      nine associated sounds. The iMSE offered an immersive and dynamic learning experience, while the PC-based method presented stimuli through a 
                      desktop computer. Results indicate that the iMSE yielded positive effects on the training outcomes of deaf children, as evidenced by improved 
                      performance and engagement. This research sheds light on the potential benefits of innovative multisensory technology in educational settings 
                      for children with hearing impairments, offering insights for future educational interventions.</p>

                      Multisensory Environments have been focused on use cases centered on learning skills and cognitive rehabilitation, which limits physical exercise 
                      to be a means rather than an end. A novel solution to this problem comes from Sensorized Climbing Walls, which will allow UX designers to explore 
                      a previously unexplored interaction mode using the entire wall as an interactive surface and suggest physical activities with a clear and central 
                      physical rehabilitation goal. Research on Sensorized Climbing Walls to date has mainly focused on measurement for enhancing performance. Merging 
                      Sensorized Climbing Walls and Multisensory Environments, new opportunities arise to offer more playful experiences to better engage patients in 
                      otherwise strenuous exercise routines. The two technologies have proven valuable assets to support children with disabilities and offer 
                      complementary sets of stimuli. The development of this new integrated system will open up a new field of study for multisensory physical 
                      rehabilitation, Multisensory Environments, and climbing therapy.</p>

                      Interactive Smart Spaces (ISSs) are physical installations equipped with digitally enriched embedded devices that can sense the users' 
                      presence and actions and generate stimulation for multiple senses. Our research focuses on ISSs for education and rehabilitation. In these 
                      domains, there is a strong need of tuning and controlling the User Experience to address the specific needs of each user or user group, a 
                      process that, in principle, should be performed by caregivers and in real-time. Nowadays, several examples of ISSs exist but they do not 
                      provide control interfaces that are powerful for customization purposes yet simple enough for caregivers, who typically have a limited 
                      technological know-how.</p>

                      The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the creation of Interactive Smart Spaces (ISSs) where different types of digital devices are integrated in 
                      the ambient or embedded in physical objects, and can sense human actions to control equipment, modify environmental parameters, or create 
                      multi-sensory effects. These IoT-enhanced interactive systems can support human activities in different contexts, eg, education, entertainment, 
                      home assistance, rehabilitation, to name a few. We argue that a human-centered perspective in the design of ISSs is needed to take into account 
                      some salient characteristics of these systems. New conceptual modeling issues also need to be investigated to go beyond representing hardware, 
                      software, and connectivity features of IoT devices and to capture the user interaction.</p>

                      This paper describes the result of an Usability Test over teachers' control interface in Magika, the powering engine of the Magic Room, a 
                      low-cost MultiSensory Environment (MSE) that enables new forms of playful learning for children, especially those with special needs. 
                      Magika offers a set of activities integrated in a synesthetic way; it incorporates digital worlds projected on the wall and on the floor 
                      with a large number of connected objects, such as toys and materials, that allow children to experience tactile, auditory, visual, and 
                      olfactory stimuli. The MSE has been installed in two elementary schools, therefore it is an essential requirement that the system can be 
                      controlled completely autonomously by caregivers. A preliminary research, based on teacher's needs, enlightened some basic requirements and 
                      allowed us to design a System Control Interface that enabled them to manage the experience within the MSE. The goals of testing the interface 
                      usability include: define a baseline of user performance, establish and validate user performance measures, and identify potential design 
                      concerns to be addressed in order to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction.
                      In this work, we explain in detail the administration of the experimental protocol to ten teachers, tested for half an hour each, of two main 
                      scenarios: the Create modality, where users explored how to configure activities and the Play modality, where they had to manage the room.</p>

                      Our research explores the potential of IoT (Internet of Things) for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD), such as Intellectual

                      space called “Magic Room” that supports interaction with “smart” objects and the entire space through body motion and objet manipulation, 
                      provides different combination of stimuli. The Magic Room has been designed in collaboration with NDD experts from a local care centre and, 
                      providing an open set of multimodal multisensory activities for children with NDD that stimulate the visual, aural, tactile, olfactory

                    <p class="abstract">Memory is defined as the capability of encoding, storing, and retrieving information and is a pillar of our cognitive functions.
                       Memory is one the most investigated processes in people with Intellectual Disability (ID), and studies have documented severe deficits in its 
                       functioning. While there are several attempts to exploit GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) to support memory training for children with ID, 
                       limited research explores Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) for this purpose. The paper describes the design and technology of a novel TUI named 
                       VIC (VIsual spatial Cubes for memory training), a system composed by a set of digitally enhanced cubes that emit light and sound, a sensorized 
                       board and a mobile app. VIC enables children to perform multiple, configurable memory training activities that involve block manipulation and 
                       block placements. The research is based on a vast analysis of the state of the art and on validated methods adopted in memory rehabilitation 
                       contexts. From this analysis, and from the theories underlying TUIs, we distilled a set of design principles that informed the design of the 
                       multi-sensory affordances of VIC, and can be exploited for other researchers to develop TUIs in this field. The paper also reports an exploratory 
                       study that involved 12 children with ID and 3 therapists from a specialized daycare Center. The study focused on the evaluation of the quality of
                       the system in terms of usability, likability and potential for adoption. Although preliminary, the results suggest that our design approach was 
                       sound and VIC has the potential to become a valid tool to complement existing practices in memory training and can be expanded to support also 
                       memory assessment for children with ID.</p>

                      persons with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD). This paper presents the experience with SAM, a dolphin-shaped smart toy. SAM is inspired 
                      by the practice of Pet Therapy and is designed to engage people with NDD in a variety of tasks through a set of multisensory stimuli and 
                      various modes of interaction. SAM can be used alone or integrated with digital content or smart space components such as digitally controlled 
                      lights, sounds, and bubble makers. SAM behavior can be customized by therapists to address the specific needs of each person with NDD. 
                      We describe the progression of SAM prototypes, from a "stand-alone" tangible object to a multimodal smart toy integrated with multimedia 
                      contents or the whole smart environment. The design process of SAM involved NDD specialists at two therapeutic centers as well as persons 
                      with NDD. From this experience, we derived some guidelines generalizable to the design of any smart toy for people with NDD.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">Cognitive rigidity and behavioral and communication problems are the most common symptoms that characterize Autism Spectrum 
                      Disorder (ASD). In fact, people with ASD face complications in everyday life, from interacting with other persons to being autonomous in the 
                      most ordinary daily tasks. To overcome these limitations and improve their quality of life, we developed 5A. 5A exploits cutting-edge 
                      technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Conversational Agents (CA), combining smartphones and wearable headsets 
                      to offer new forms of intervention to persons with ASD. Virtual reality experiences enable learning common tasks, such as using public transport, 
                      through simulation in a safe environment. When people are in similar real-life situations, AR can help them generalize the skills they have

                    <p class="abstract">Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability characterised by cognitive rigidity and communication and behavioural 
                      deficits. These deficits negatively impact the lives of people with ASD by making them unable to complete daily activities and even communicate 
                      with others. In order to support persons with ASD in their everyday life, facilitate their social inclusion, and improve their quality of life, 
                      we developed 5A. 5A provides innovative tools based on smartphones and wearable headsets that integrate Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality 
                      (AR), and Conversational Agents (CA). These applications help persons with ASD understand the environmental and socio-organizational 
                      characteristics of everyday life scenarios and correctly perform related activities. Experiences in VR allow simulating typical tasks of such 
                      scenarios, e.g., taking the subway. When people find themselves in similar situations in real life, AR helps them generalise the skills acquired 
                      in VR by superimposing interactive multimedia elements on the view of the surrounding physical world. In both VR and AR, a personalised 
                      Conversational Assistant provides prompts and personalised feedback.</p>

                      problems. These issues dramatically affect their everyday life abilities, such as interacting with others or being autonomous in most daily 
                      tasks. 5A project aims at supporting ASD individuals by exploiting the combination of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and 
                      Conversational Agents (CA). Using low-cost headsets and smartphones, 5A offers a unique intervention for ASD people. The VR training allows 
                      the user to learn how to perform daily tasks in a safe and controlled environment. The AR experience enables the generalization of the acquired 
                      skills in real-world settings. Finally, the customizable CA assists and prompts the user at every step in both experiences. As a first use 
                      case for 5A applications, we report its use in urban mobility with trains. A case study evaluation was conducted, measuring the effect of 5A 
                      apps on 5 ASD users. Our preliminary results showed that users had improved their autonomy level (perceived and measured by external caregivers). 
                      The first lessons learned by this study are also reported as a set of guidelines about technology usage, design, and experimentation for 
                      immersive technologies in support of persons with ASD.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that can affect autonomy and independence. Our research explores 
                      the integration of Cross-Reality and Conversational Agents for Autistic persons to improve ability and confidence in everyday life situations. 
                      We combine two technologies of the Virtual-Real continuum. User experiences unfold from the simulation of tasks in VR to the execution of similar 
                      tasks supported by AR in the real world. A speech-based Conversational Agent is integrated with both VR and AR. It provides contextualized help, 
                      promotes generalization, and stimulates users to apply what they learned in the virtual space. The paper presents the approach and describes an
                      empirical study involving 17 young Autistic persons.</p>
