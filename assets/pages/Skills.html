        <p>
          Defining your skills is a very hrechearous task: it is like navigating a thin line between overestiamtion ans underesimation of oneself. 
          I believe my skills are at the intersection of creativity, technology, and problem-solving. 
          I have developed them in several years of project participation, management and organization, with multidisciplinary teams and
          an extremely wide vaiety of professionals. I have learned so much from all of them and I am eager o continue to grow and learn more.
          Here I am collecting some of my working related skills.
