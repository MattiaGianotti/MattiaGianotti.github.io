        <p>
          Defining one's skills is a delicate exercise, a balancing act between overestimation and underestimation of one's abilities. I believe my skills lie at 
          the intersection of creativity, technology, and problem-solving. These skills have been honed through years of active participation, management, and 
          organization of projects involving multidisciplinary teams and an incredibly diverse range of professionals. Working alongside such talented individuals 
          has been a profound learning experience, enriching my expertise and broadening my perspective. 
          I am grateful for these experiences and remain eager to grow further, embracing every opportunity to learn and refine my capabilities.
          Below, I have curated a list of some of my professional skills to provide a clearer picture of my expertise.

                            groups on coding projects to multidisciplinary teams of over 20 professionals for large-scale, impactful research initiatives.

                            I come from an engineering background, but during my joint Ph.D. with the School of Design, I gained valuable experience in both 
                            qualitative and quantitative UX research. My work has included engaging with some of the most challenging user groups, such as 
                            individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, which has deepened my understanding of user-centered design.
                            I am highly confident in my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) expertise and gamification UX skills, and I am eager to apply them to new 
                            fields and challenges.

                            about the field and to share that journey with others. I believe that leadership is about empowering the people around you to express 
                            their talents and grow together as a team.
