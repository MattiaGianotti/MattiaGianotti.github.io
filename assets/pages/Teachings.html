        <p>
          During all these years of research I had the immense priviledge and pleasure to be involved in several teaching activiyties.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been involved initially as a teaching assistant during all my Ph.D. years and as a research assistant. In this time I was able to 
          learn how to create lessons, support stutend in developing unque projects usign the most advanced technologies for Human Computer Interaction
          available in our laboratory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last three years I had become the teacher responsigle for some modules inside courses, learning how to plan and manage also the 
          organizatioanl aspects of a university level teaching. I put all my efforts in creating engaging, lightweight courses focused more on the 
          practical aspects of project making and managig with respect to a limited theoretical knowledge, opting for a "Learn by doing" approach
           and with great pleasure I can state that students have always appreciated my teaching methods and my aptitude towards teaching, scoring pretty high
           marks in the satisfaction questionnaires.

            The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love 
            is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.

                      for project representation and communication. The Computer Graphics Laboratory integrates the disciplines of communication design, 
                      computer science, and representation, addressing the development of artifacts for visual communication with particular attention to the 
                      third dimension, in space and time. Topics are covered both theoretically and practically, to build knowledge based on solid conceptual 
                      foundations and a design capability aware of the main communication mechanisms.
                      The Applied Informatics module focuses on web communication, addressing themes related to the presentation of Computer Graphics content 
                      and the design and development of dynamic and interactive artifacts. The Digital Drawing module covers the transition from two-dimensional 
                      representation to the creation of three-dimensional models, analyzing geometries, transformations, lighting, visual rendering of materials, 
                      and tools supporting the construction and visualization of 3D models in the digital space, as well as the process of creating synthetic images.
                      The Techniques of Representation module focuses on aspects related to the design of non-linear and interactive narrative structures based 
                      on three-dimensional digital artifacts.
                      The course is structured in cycles of lectures, practical exercises applying the acquired knowledge, and tests to assess theoretical 
                      understanding.</p>

                      user interface design approaches, tools and methodologies and digital technologies.
                      It's a comprehensive and intensive design workshop that combines design and technology, introducing and applying the key tools and methodologies 
                      of the user experience design and user centered design. Through lectures and workshops activities and supported by the teaching team, 
                      the students will work in teams to design, develop and present an interactive prototype combining software and hardware components (Arduino).
                      The course structure follows the key UX Design process stages:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          User Centred Design approach and tools: putting people first with user research, personas, customer journey mapping and user scenarios.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Concept and service design: problem definition, ideation and conceptualisation starting from the research findings, development and 
                          presentation of a digital product/service concept.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Detailed design: information architecture, interaction model, wireframes, user interface design for different devices and screens, 
                          basic usability evaluation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Digital technologies and prototyping: introduction to web and mobile apps technologies, tangible interaction, Arduino programming and 
                          internet of things.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Final presentation: Design solution consolidation, prototyping (digital and physical) and presentation with different visualisation techniques.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      Each design workshop stage will end with a presentation that will be assessed by the teaching team and will contribute to the final grade.
                      The project brief will be provided at the beginning of the course.This course is part of a cross-disciplinary integrated coordination</div>

                    <p class="abstract">Computing devices and digitally enhanced artefacts are ubiquitously present in most human activities and are smoothly 
                      integrated in the fabric of our everyday life, making our living space “smart”. Interactive multimedia content is pervasively available in 
                      large or small displays; sensors and actuators are embedded in objects, appliances, vehicles, lights, or furniture; digital “extensions of 
                      our body” are available through wearable devices like smart watches, wristbands, or virtual/augmented reality headsets such as Google Cardboard, 
                      Samsung Gear VR, or Microsoft Hololens. Physical artifacts and digital devices are Internet-connected, and users communicate with them using 
                      new interaction paradigms that go beyond “click” or “touch" and include gestures, body movements, speech, or tangible manipulation.
                      This scenario opens up opportunities for new applications in many domain. Still, as the power of technology increases, we face the challenge 
                      of how to design the interfaces and interaction modes so that end users can use these technologies in a meaningful way for meaningful tasks.
                      This course helps students to address this challenge, and provides some methodological and technological know-how needed to master the 
                      complexity of these new technologies and to develop innovative solutions in this arena. The course also stimulates a thinking “out of the box” 
                      attitude and the attention to user needs and requirements, which are crucial to exploit the full potential of novel interctive technologies 
                      and to address the related challenges.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">The course of Hypermedia applciation aims at providing students with the methodological and technical knowledge and 
                      skills needed to develop, in a systematic and efficient way, high quality web-based multi-device hypermedia applications (for desktop 
                      computer, tablet, or smart phone).
                      The course focuses on both the technological aspects of web development, and the methodological and software design perspective. On the 
                      technological side, the course focuses on Multilayer Web Architectures, Cloud Computing, Web protocol, Multimedia Formats, Web vs Hybrid vs 
                      Native Applications, together with more practical knowledge on the most common impleentation technologies for web implemntation (html, js, css, 
                      php, vue.js, SQL, nodeJS). On the methodological side It proposes IDM (Interactive Dialogue Model) as a means to define and represent information 
                      architecture, navigation, interaction, and presentation features of complex multi-device applications that are truly usable, i.e., easy to use 
                      and consistent with users' requirements.
