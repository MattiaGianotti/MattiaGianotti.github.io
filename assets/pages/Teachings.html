        <p>
          Over the year studyplans, I have had the immense privilege and pleasure of being involved in <b>various teaching activities</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my Ph.D. and research assistantship, I started as a <b>teaching assistant</b>, gaining valuable experience in designing lessons and supporting students 
          as they <b>developed unique projects</b>. These projects often leveraged cutting-edge Human-Computer Interaction technologies available in our laboratory, allowing 
          students to push creative and technical boundaries, and often transformed in Master Thesis projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past three accademic years, I have taken on the role of a <b>module leader within university courses</b>. This position has taught me how to effectively plan and 
          manage the <b>organizational aspects of higher education teaching</b>. I have dedicated myself to creating engaging, hands-on courses that prioritize the practical 
          aspects of project creation and management over purely theoretical knowledge. Embracing a "Learn by Doing" approach, my aim has always been to make learning 
          an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
          It brings me great satisfaction to know that my teaching methods and dedication <b>have resonated well with students</b>, as reflected in consistently high scores 
          in their satisfaction questionnaires.

            The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love 
            is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.

                      The laboratory equips students with the essential skills to manage innovative product and system design projects. The course emphasizes a 
                      comprehensive process, including context research, prototyping, and validation, while focusing on mastering techniques and tools relevant to 
                      the key phases of project development: idea inspiration, creation, and implementation.
                      An important aspect of the program is teaching students how to effectively present their project outcomes across all stages of the process. 
                      This includes applying storytelling and storyboarding principles and experimenting with creative, expressive, narrative, and interaction methods 
                      to communicate their ideas compellingly and effectively.</p>

                      The rapid evolution of digital technologies and modes of communication has expanded the possibilities for project representation and information 
                      exchange. The Computer Graphics Laboratory integrates communication design, computer science, and representation disciplines, emphasizing the 
                      creation of artifacts for visual communication with a focus on three-dimensionality in space and time.
                      The course combines theoretical foundations with practical applications, fostering a solid conceptual understanding alongside a design capability 
                      informed by core communication mechanisms.

                      This course challenges students to design and prototype a digital service or interactive application by applying User Experience (UX) Design, 
                      Interaction Design, and User Interface (UI) Design methodologies, tools, and technologies. It is an intensive, hands-on design workshop that 
                      merges design principles with technology, guiding students through the key stages of the UX design process. Students will work in teams, 
                      supported by the teaching staff, to design, develop, and present an interactive prototype that integrates both software and hardware components 
                      (e.g., Arduino). The course follows a structured process:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          User-Centered Design (UCD) Approach and Tools: Focus on user research to understand needs and contexts. Students will create personas, 
                          customer journey maps, and user scenarios, putting people first in the design process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Concept and Service Design: Starting from research findings, students will define problems, ideate solutions, conceptualize, and develop 
                          a digital product or service concept.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Detailed Design: This stage includes information architecture, interaction models, wireframes, and UI designs optimized for various 
                          devices and screen sizes. Basic usability evaluations are also introduced.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Digital Technologies and Prototyping: Students will explore web and mobile application development, tangible interaction, Arduino 
                          programming, and Internet of Things (IoT) integration.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Final Presentation: Teams will consolidate their designs and create both digital and physical prototypes. The project will culminate in 
                          a comprehensive presentation employing advanced visualization techniques.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      Each stage of the design workshop concludes with a presentation assessed by the teaching team, contributing to the final grade. A project 
                      brief will be provided at the course's outset, offering direction and context. This course fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, integrating 
                      technology and design to develop innovative solutions.

                      Computing devices and digitally enhanced artifacts are ubiquitous in most human activities, seamlessly integrated into the fabric of our everyday lives, making our living spaces “smart.” 
                      Interactive multimedia content is widely available on large and small displays; sensors and actuators are embedded in objects, appliances, vehicles, lights, and furniture. Digital “extensions of our 
                      body” are provided through wearable devices such as smartwatches, wristbands, or virtual/augmented reality headsets like Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, and Microsoft Hololens. Physical artifacts 
                      and digital devices are connected to the Internet, enabling users to interact with them through new paradigms that go beyond “click” or “touch,” incorporating gestures, body movements, speech, and 
                      tangible manipulation. This scenario opens up opportunities for new applications across many domains. However, as the power of technology increases, we face the challenge of designing interfaces 
                      and interaction modes that enable end users to engage with these technologies meaningfully and effectively for their intended tasks. This course helps students address these challenges by providing 
                      the methodological and technological expertise needed to navigate the complexity of emerging technologies and develop innovative solutions. It also fosters an “out-of-the-box” mindset and an emphasis 
                      on user needs and requirements—both critical for harnessing the full potential of novel interactive technologies and tackling the associated challenges.

                      The course of Hypermedia applciation aims at providing students with the methodological and technical knowledge and 
                      skills needed to develop, in a systematic and efficient way, high quality web-based multi-device hypermedia applications (for desktop 
                      computer, tablet, or smart phone).
                      The course focuses on both the technological aspects of web development, and the methodological and software design perspective. On the 
                      technological side, the course focuses on Multilayer Web Architectures, Cloud Computing, Web protocol, Multimedia Formats, Web vs Hybrid vs 
                      Native Applications, together with more practical knowledge on the most common impleentation technologies for web implemntation (html, js, css, 
                      php, vue.js, SQL, nodeJS). On the methodological side It proposes IDM (Interactive Dialogue Model) as a means to define and represent information 
                      architecture, navigation, interaction, and presentation features of complex multi-device applications that are truly usable, i.e., easy to use 
                      and consistent with users' requirements.
