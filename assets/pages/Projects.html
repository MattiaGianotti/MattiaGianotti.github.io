        <p>
          All my years of research has been focused on participating in several research proposals and projects. All of those research projects
          have been conducted in multisciplinary teams, allowing me the opportunity to open up my horizonts and learn form the best in several differnt fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these years have contributed equally in national projects, involving two or more departments or univerities, and international projects, involving 
            at least foreign universities and companies form all around europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially I have participated as a simple participants, but in the last years I have coverd technical leadership roles in several national and 
          international projects, managing small groups of colleagues on a dally basis and organizing the works of larger multidisciplinary groups.

                                        monitor the increasingly high demand for help from the most disadvantaged population and provide more efficient focused and coordinated 
                                        intervention
                                        The number of charities (“No-profit institutions providing social assistance to disadvantaged people”) is expanding at a growth rate higher 
                                        than market oriented enterprises (350000 charities in Italy only). Increasing the efficiency of charities' interventions by optimizing 
                                        resources allocation and offering to charities and city agencies means to monitor the demand for assistance and how it is addressed, 
                                        improves their coordination and reduces costs for both types of social assistance bodies.
                                        Exacerbated by Covid, there is an increasing demand for food, medicine and basic assistance from the disadvantaged population, e.g. the 
                                        elderly who live alone, homeless persons, families with disabled subjects, the unemployed. Through INCLUDE their needs are better 
                                        monitored and these people receive assistance in a timelier, more efficient and personalized way, while the city has a more 
                                        comprehensive up-to-date view of the situation of this population to define more effective social policies
                                        INCLUDE product integrates a tool for charities operators that exploits a ML technique to match automatically the requests for help from the
                                        population to human resources (volunteers); this tools is integrated with a mobile app for volunteers to be alerted, manage the assigned service, 
                                        and report interventions; It also provides an info-visualization tool for charity managers based on the charity data about people's requests to 
                                        monitor and analyse the needs status of the disadvantaged population they served and a a data analysis and visualization tool for city managers.

                                    <p class="abstract">In ageing European societies, the number of elderly people as a percentage of the overall population is 
                                        constantly increasing, while fewer and fewer people choose to become healthcare professionals. Care institutions and hospitals, 
                                        therefore, are facing serious staffing shortages and heavy work pressure has proven to be related to poor quality of care 
                                        and to incidents such as medication errors.
                                        The robotics assistants developed as a result of this EIT Digital innovation activity and commercialised by SARA Robotics 
                                        provide a turnkey hardware and software solution for care institutions and hospitals to improve care recipients' quality 
                                        of life and provide support to alleviate caregiver-staffing shortages. For instance, the SARA robot can support elderly 
                                        people suffering from first-stage dementia to perform specific exercises designed to improve their mental and physical 
                                        fitness and delay entering the second, more acute stage of the illness.
                                        The robot can also play games, support music therapy and perform repetitive tasks, such as reminding staff and clients
                                        of certain events and checking the client's wellbeing.</p>

                                        ActivE³ aims to enter primary schools so that all children can have the opportunity to experience sports as a playful, 
                                        educational, and inclusive activity, regardless of their physical or cognitive challenges. This involves the design and

                                        and interactive. Inside the Magic Room, children can play multisensory games and learning activities tailored to the needs of 
                                        the single child, that are particularly stimulating and involving. LudoMi partners are educational and therapeutically
