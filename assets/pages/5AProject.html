        <p class="importanttextIntro">5A - Autonomie per l'Autismo Attraverso realtà virtuale, realtà Aumentata e Agenti conversazionali</p>
        <p>
          The 5A project involves the use of interactive applications and innovative tools based on smartphones and wearable headsets that integrate Immersive 
          Virtual Reality (IVR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Conversational Agents (CA). The purpose of the project is to enhance the autonomy of individuals 
          with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) to promote their social inclusion and improve their quality of life. By integrating various scenarios, the 5A 
          applications help individuals with ASD understand the environmental and socio-organizational characteristics of everyday living environments and 
          correctly perform related activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project we created several prototypes of IVR and AR experiences (e.g., public transportation, supermarket, museum) and created an experiemtnable
          showcase of two experiences to perform training for the use of the underground and the train line. The project was one of the most prominent example of 
          Cross Reality, where elements (called transmedia element) were used in both IVR and AR experiences to create a unique and uniform experience for the user,
          on top of an engaging conversatioanl agent that made the user completely autonomous in the experience.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2020 - 2023</p>

              <p>
                The experience in 5A is divided into two major moments: an initial safe training in Virtual Reality, and a situated trainign in Augmented Reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) offers realistic and engaging experiences due to its immersive nature (using wearable headsets) and its accessibility 
                anytime, anywhere. These experiences allow for the simulation of typical tasks within various everyday life scenarios.
                Augmented Reality (AR) enables the generalization of skills acquired in IVR by overlaying interactive multimedia elements onto the surrounding 
                physical world, creating a seamless connection between training in the virtual world and experiences in the real world.
                We created two demo scenarios: one in the unerground and one on the train system. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Experiences in both IVR and  AR are managed by a central core node using a multimodal finite state machine that obtain information from both 
                the IVR interaction (gaze, selection and movement of the player), AR interaction (image recognition, click on the screen), and audio recording (analizded
                with the help of Speech to Text and Natural Language Progessing algorithm), and determine the next state of the visualization (both in IVR and AR), and 
                the next sentece to be uttered, to help, support, inform, or provide hints to the users.

              One of the most important aspect of the technological infrastructure of 5A project is its information structure. The objectiv was to allow any caregiver
              to be able to create and costumize the experiences. For this reason, the IVR and AR engines are basic, while all the logic of the traiining is embedded 
              inside our server. This server embeds a certain number of elementary Finite State Machine (FSM) engines, one for each interaction in IVR and AR, plus some 
              support machine to handle the help request and the emergency exit commands. Then the experience is built as a combination of parallel state machine 
              defining the execution flow of the project. The great headsup that allows our system to allow (potentially) any caregiver to generate their experience is that 
              all the structure of the FSM is defined in a google sheet document, properly formatted to avoid mistakes in writing. From within the file itself is was possible
              to invoke a pipeline to trasnform the tabular version into javascript code compiled in the production server in seconds. Using the same approach, our chatbot 
              was also using a tabular system allowing the caregivers to perfectly tailor the system utterances to the precise need of each user.

              The IVR setup required a smartphone, a low-cost visot (e.g., a cardboard visor) and a controller to be connected wia bluetooth to the phone. 
              To allow caregivers to be able to follw the users, a screen and a screencast device could be used.
              For the AR setup, the same smartphone was sufficient. We also created recognizable images to help the user in case of problems in framing or 
              recognizing the world elements.
              During our experiemtnal sessions users performed the IVR task in the care centers or at home alone, while AR setup was always performed with a caregiver.

            <div class="description">
              <p>
                My role has been of Work Package Leader of the project. In this project I had to coordinate a team of 5 computer scientist and 8 psychologysts and cargivers 
                in preparing materials, organizing tasks, testing and providing constructive feedback. It has been challenging working in such a multidisciplinary team,
                but it has thought me a lot about managing people form different backgrounds, allowing them to express their potential and keep them all focused on the objective.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also in charge of the development of the chatbot and the FSM management system, together with the transformation of the tables into executable code dynamically.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally I was also the supervisor of the Master thesists who developed the AR experience schema, especially managing the complexity of the uncontrolled real world
                environemtn and all the recovery mechanism we had to include to support the user at any point in the slow.
