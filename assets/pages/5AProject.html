            5A - Autonomie per l'Autismo Attraverso realtà virtuale, realtà
            Aumentata e Agenti conversazionali
          </p>
          <p>
            The 5A project involves the use of interactive applications and innovative tools based on smartphones and wearable headsets that
            integrate Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Conversational Agents (CA). The purpose of the project is to
            enhance the autonomy of individuals with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) to promote their social inclusion and improve their
            quality of life. By integrating various scenarios, the 5A applications help individuals with ASD understand the environmental
            and socio-organizational characteristics of everyday living environments and correctly perform related activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project we created several prototypes of IVR and AR experiences (e.g., public transportation, supermarket, museum) and
            created an experiemtnable showcase of two experiences to perform training for the use of the underground and the train line. The
            project was one of the most prominent example of Cross Reality, where elements (called transmedia element) were used in both IVR and
            AR experiences to create a unique and uniform experience for the user, on top of an engaging conversatioanl agent that made the user
            completely autonomous in the experience.

                  The experience in 5A is divided into two major phases: an initial safe training session in Virtual Reality (VR), followed by a situated training session in 
                  Augmented Reality (AR).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) provides realistic and engaging experiences through its immersive nature, using wearable headsets, and its 
                  accessibility, enabling training anytime, anywhere. These experiences simulate typical tasks within various everyday life scenarios. Augmented 
                  Reality (AR) helps generalize skills acquired in IVR by overlaying interactive multimedia elements onto the surrounding physical world, thus 
                  creating a seamless connection between virtual training and real-world experiences. For demonstration purposes, we created two scenarios: one 
                  in an underground environment and another in a train system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both IVR and AR experiences are managed by a central core node using a multimodal finite state machine. This system gathers data from IVR 
                  interactions (gaze, selection, and movement), AR interactions (image recognition, screen clicks), and audio recordings (analyzed with Speech-to-Text 
                  and Natural Language Processing algorithms). The core system determines the next state of the visualization (both in IVR and AR) and generates the 
                  next sentence to be uttered, providing support, guidance, information, or hints to the user.

                One of the most important aspects of the technological infrastructure in the 5A project is its information architecture. The goal was to empower 
                caregivers to easily create and customize experiences. To achieve this, the IVR and AR engines are kept simple, with the logic for the training 
                embedded in our server. This server houses several elementary Finite State Machine (FSM) engines, one for each interaction in both IVR and AR, 
                along with additional support machines to handle help requests and emergency exit commands.
                The experience is built as a combination of parallel state machines, which define the execution flow of the project. What sets our system apart and 
                allows virtually any caregiver to generate their own experiences is that the entire structure of the FSM is defined in a Google Sheet document, 
                formatted to minimize errors during input. From within the document, a pipeline can be invoked to automatically transform the tabular data into
                JavaScript code, which is then compiled on the production server within seconds.
                Using the same approach, our chatbot system is also powered by a tabular system, enabling caregivers to precisely tailor the system's utterances 
                to meet the specific needs of each user.

                The IVR (Immersive Virtual Reality) setup required just a smartphone, a low-cost visor (such as a cardboard visor), and a Bluetooth-connected 
                controller. To allow caregivers to monitor the users' progress, a screen and screencasting device could be used. For the AR (Augmented Reality) 
                setup, the same smartphone was sufficient. Additionally, we created recognizable images to assist users in case of issues with framing or recognizing 
                the elements in the environment. During our experimental sessions, users performed the IVR tasks either in care centers or at home, independently. 
                The AR setup, however, was always conducted with a caregiver present to provide support.

            <p>
              In this project, I served as the Work Package Leader, coordinating a multidisciplinary team of 5 computer scientists and 8 psychologists and caregivers. 
              My responsibilities included preparing materials, organizing tasks, overseeing testing, and providing constructive feedback. Working in such a diverse 
              team was challenging, but it taught me a lot about managing people from different backgrounds. I learned how to help team members express their potential 
              while keeping everyone focused on our shared objectives.

            <p>
              I was also in charge of developing the chatbot and the FSM (Finite State Machine) management system, including the dynamic transformation of tables into 
              executable code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I supervised the Master's thesis projects, guiding the development of the AR experience schema. This included managing the complexities 
              of the uncontrolled real-world environment and designing recovery mechanisms to support users throughout the experience.
