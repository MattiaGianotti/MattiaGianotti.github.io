        <p>
          Spark is an evolution of Lands of Fog game realized at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcellona) at FuBIntLab following the 
          guide of Prof. Narcìs Parés. I had the opportunity to do a visiting Ph.D. period at their lab and, together with a master 
          thesist I was supervising, we were asked to design a evolution of Lands of Fog, starting from the analysis of it limitations.
          Spark is an innovative technological enhanced smart space designed to aid specialists in the care of HFASC (high-functioning 
          autistic people) children to foster their social skills. The collaborative virtual environment was designed to scaffold 
          social interaction by immersing children into an abstract space which would enable a mixed couple of HFASC child and normotypical 
          children to cooperate close or at a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project we created a prototype improving the original Lands Of Fog software and hardware setup, focusign more on
          the generative part of the game. In a second iteration the hardware used to track users' posiotion had been redesigned.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2019 - 2020 (project interrupted due to Covid19 Pandemic)</p>

            <div class="description">
              <p>
                Spark used a single 6x6 meters floor projection and directional audio to immerse the children in a space-like exploration experience.
                Spark brings a dyad of children, one atypical and one normotypical, in a free open-ended game. The experience is 
                designed to foster continuously cooperation. However the lack of defined goal and precise instruction has been designed to let the 
                children explore and discover autonomously that by cooperating with the playmate they can achieve greater results
              </p>
              <p>
                Our system can adapt in real time depending on the behavior of the children and their interaction. 
                The system can measure the status of the interaction and try to adapt the context of the play 
                session in the best possible way. The first aim is to help users discover the new interaction possibilities they have 
                yet to discover. A second aim is to reduce the isolation and steretypical behaviors during the game.
                Finally, the last aim is to hint different discovery path to make the children interested in coming back playing for a longer period.

              <p>
                The system's generation of content instead is based on 8 particle types, identified by different clearly distinguishable colors 
                and seven astral elements: white holes, gift particles, roaming elements, asteroids, planets, stars and blackholes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each level if randomly geenrated by picking up a set of 4 particle types and populated dynamically. 
                White holes allow Single Player interactions: once a player stand on top of it for few seconds, a stream of gift particles erupts 
                towards the other child and, once reached, start orbiting around him/her. Once those particles interact with a roaming element 
                they are converted into a planet. 
                If two players coordinate and activate (almost) simultaneously two withe holes, the two stream of gift particles collide in the middle. 
                the result, according to the match of types, can either be a visual-acoustic rewarding effect or the creation of a star. 
                Similarly to the planet, the size, color and number of rings of the star depend on the particle types involved.
                Size, color, number of moons and rings and luminosity are decided according to the types and number of gift particles involved.
                Planets can be moved when both players are next to it and move in the same direction.
                Once all the orbits of the planet have been filled the solar system collapse onto the star generating a black hole.
                When the two players are together on top the black hole an effect is performed to move the children smoothly from the current level to a 
                new level, which follows the same rules but has a different set of colors, letting the children explore new possible combinations.

              The virtual space is enabled by two high-quality projectors were mounted onto scaffolds and positioned on opposite ends of the room. 
              The projectors were oriented towards the floor, allowing the projection of a six-by-six-meter play area. The floor was equipped 
              with special, white tiles providing a high-quality projection surface. A two-speaker system was used allowing the reproduction 
              of panned audio. Both speakers were set to a low volume to not discourage users from speaking. Four cameras were positioned 
              beneath the ceiling, centered above the play area. The four cameras together covered the whole play area and allowed the detection 
              of colored lights within the play area.
              Interact with the virtual elements from the physical world is mediated by a custom-made handheld device; It has two main effects: 
              it helps the children to be focused on the interaction; and it helps the children clearly determine how and where they 
              are affecting the play-space.

              <p>
                My role has been of Lead Developer of the project. I was the main designer of the genrative algorithm, the interaction mechanism and the 
                visuals feeling. I was also the developer of this part of the project, excpet for the 3d modelling of the objects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also the supervisor of the Master thesist who programmed the hint system as well as the supervisor of the experiemtnal study.
                Unfortunately pandemic breakthrough forbade us to complete the empirical evalaution of the project.
