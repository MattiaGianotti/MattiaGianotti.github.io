        <p>
          Spark is an evolution of the "Lands of Fog" game, developed at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona) under the guidance of Prof. Narcís Parés. 
          During my visiting Ph.D. period at their lab, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a master's student I was supervising to design an evolution of 
          "Lands of Fog," starting with an analysis of its limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spark is an innovative, technologically enhanced smart space designed to aid specialists in the care of children with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum 
          Condition (HFASC) by fostering their social skills. The collaborative virtual environment was designed to support social interaction by immersing children 
          in an abstract space, allowing a mixed group of HFASC and neurotypical children to cooperate both at close range and at a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we created a prototype that improved upon the original "Lands of Fog" software and hardware setup, with a focus on enhancing the generative 
          aspects of the game. In a second iteration, the hardware used to track users' positions was redesigned.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2019 - 2020 (project interrupted due to Covid19 Pandemic)</p>

              <p>
                Spark utilizes a 6x6 meter floor projection and directional audio to immerse children in a space-like exploration experience. The game pairs a dyad 
                of children—one atypical and one normotypical—in a free, open-ended game. The experience is designed to foster continuous cooperation. However, the 
                lack of a defined goal or precise instructions encourages children to explore and discover autonomously that by cooperating with their playmate, 
                they can achieve greater results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our system adapts in real-time based on the behavior and interactions of the children. It continuously measures the status of their engagement and 
                adjusts the context of the play session accordingly. The primary goal is to help users discover new interaction possibilities. A secondary goal is 
                to reduce isolation and stereotypical behaviors during the game. Finally, we aim to guide children along various discovery paths, encouraging them 
                to return and engage for longer periods.

              <p>
                The system's content generation is based on 8 particle types, each identified by a distinct, easily recognizable color, and seven astral elements: white 
                holes, gift particles, roaming elements, asteroids, planets, stars, and black holes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each level is randomly generated by selecting a set of 4 particle types and populating it dynamically. White holes facilitate Single Player 
                interactions: when a player stands on top of one for a few seconds, a stream of gift particles erupts towards the other child and begins to orbit 
                around them. When these particles interact with a roaming element, they transform into a planet.
                If the two players coordinate and activate (almost) simultaneously two white holes, the two streams of gift particles collide in the middle. 
                The outcome, depending on the types involved, may result in a visual and acoustic reward or the creation of a star. Similar to planets, the size, 
                color, and number of rings of the star depend on the particle types involved.
                The size, color, number of moons and rings, and luminosity of planets and stars are determined by the types and quantity of gift particles involved. 
                Planets can be moved when both players are near and moving in the same direction. Once all the orbits of the planet are filled, the solar system 
                collapses into the star, generating a black hole.
                When both players stand on top of the black hole, an effect transports them smoothly to a new level. The new level follows the same rules but 
                features a different set of colors, allowing the children to explore new combinations and possibilities.

            </div>
            <div class="description">
              The virtual space is enabled by two high-quality projectors mounted on scaffolds at opposite ends of the room. These projectors are oriented towards 
              the floor, projecting onto a six-by-six-meter play area. The floor is equipped with special white tiles that provide a high-quality surface for the 
              projections.
              A two-speaker system is used to produce panned audio, set to a low volume to avoid discouraging conversation among the users. Four cameras, 
              positioned beneath the ceiling and centered above the play area, cover the entire space and detect colored lights within the area.
              Interaction with the virtual elements from the physical world is facilitated by a custom-made handheld device. This device serves two main purposes: 
              it helps the children focus on the interaction, and it allows them to clearly determine how and where they are affecting the play space.

            My role was Lead Developer of the project. I was the main designer of the generative algorithm, the interaction mechanisms, and the visual experience. 
            I was also the developer for these components, except for the 3D modeling of the objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I supervised the Master's thesis project, where the student developed the hint system, and I also oversaw the experimental study. Unfortunately, 
            the outbreak of the pandemic prevented us from completing the empirical evaluation of the project.
