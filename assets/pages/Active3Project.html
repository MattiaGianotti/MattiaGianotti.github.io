        <p>
          The ActivE³ - Everyone, Everywhere, Everyday project is a large-scale initiative involving several departments and professionals at Politecnico di Milano. 
          It began in the final months of 2022 and was selected and funded with €3.5 million by Fondazione Cariplo and Regione Lombardia. 
          Univerlecco is the project coordinator, and it also involves: Politecnico di Milano - Polo Territoriale di Lecco, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - 
          Sede di Lecco, IRCCS “Eugenio Medea” - Associazione La Nostra Famiglia, Fondazione Valduce, Ospedale Valduce, Centro di Riabilitazione “Villa Beretta”, 
          IRCCS INRCA di Casatenovo, ASST Lecco, and ATS Brianza.
      </p>
      <p>
          The ActivE³ project addresses the needs of children and teenagers for whom sport is essential for growth and social interaction in both school and leisure 
          activities, as well as adults for whom sport provides distraction, social connections, and prevention.
      </p>
      <p>
          As part of the project, our aim was to evolve the Magic Room concept by incorporating a Sensorized Climbing Wall, 
          which was created by developing an extensive sensor network to integrate with the IoT interface of the Magic Room.
      </p>

            <div class="description"> 
              <p> 
                The climbing wall consists of a standard climbing wall support, on which some of the regular hold sockets have been replaced with holes to accommodate 
                the sensors. The climbing wall measures 3.60 x 2.40 meters, providing ample space for children to climb. Safety cushions are positioned around the 
                climbing wall to comply with safety requirements. Motorized screen projectors can cover the climbing wall if needed to prevent distractions for the 
                children. 
              </p> 
              <p> 
                Each sensor is connected in a chain and linked to a CAN bus, with a standardized socket to attach commercially available holds. 
                A corner node collects the data from each sensor’s strength measurements and then exposes the data through APIs on the local network. A new module 
                in the Magic Room management system calls these APIs, processes the strength signals, dynamically filters the results, and provides aggregated 
                measures for the games.

        <div class="roledescription"> 
          <p> 
            My role was twofold. On one hand, I was responsible for developing the integration middleware to include the Sensorized Climbing Wall sensor network
            within the Magic Room architecture. To complete this part of the project, I organized the work of colleagues to determine the necessary modifications 
            to the core system of the existing Sensorized Climbing Wall. Additionally, I coordinated the work of a subteam dedicated to defining the AI algorithm 
            to enhance the multiperson triangulation of full-body tracking, performed using edge computing approaches. 
          </p> 
          <p> 
            The second part of my role involved developing and supervising activities to showcase the integration of the systems. I developed one activity and 
            supervised a Master's thesis student while he developed another. Finally, I created the control applications for the field study in which we measured 
            the effect of combining climbing and multisensoriality on the social behaviors of the users. The results of the study are reported in a paper currently 
            under revision.

                      This game is inspired by climbing exercises that involve completing paths. One child acts as the Guide and views a map of the climbing wall

                      climber the holds that lie ahead. The other player must climb from the start to the target without using any of the forbidden holds.
