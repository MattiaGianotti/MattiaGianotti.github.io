        <p>
          The ActivE³ - Everyone, Evrywhere, Everyday project is a vast project involving several departments and professionalism in the Politecnico Milano.
          It started in the last months of 2022, has been selected and financed with 3.5 million euros by Fondazione Cariplo and Regione Lombardia. 
          Univerlecco is the coordinator of the project that also involves: Politecnico di Milano - Polo territoriale di Lecco, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche
          - sede di Lecco, IRCCS “Eugenio Medea” - Associazione La Nostra Famiglia, Fondazione Valduce, Ospedale Valduce, Centro di Riabilitazione “Villa Beretta”, 
          IRCCS INRCA di Casatenovo, ASST Lecco e ATS Brianza.
          ActivE³ activities address the needs of children and teenagers for whom sport is essential for growth and social life in school and in their free time, 
          adults for whom sport means distraction, social relationships and prevention. 

        </p>
        <p>
          In the project our aim was to evolte the Magic Room project including a Sensorized Climbing Wall, 
          realized creating a wide sensor network to be included in the IoT interface of the Magic Room.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2022 - present</p>

            <div class="description">
              <p>
                The climbing wall is consituted of standard clibing wall support on which some standard hold sockets have been substituted with holes 
                to accomodate the sensor. The climbing wall measures 3.60x2.40 meters to offer a sufficient climbing area for children.
                Safety cuscions have been dislocated around the climbing wall to comply with security requirements. Motorized screen projectots 
                can cover the climbing wall in case of need to aoid children getting distracted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each sensor is connected into a chain and connected to a CAN bus and have a standardized socket to connect commercially available holds.
                A corne node retrieve the data of each sensors' strenght measurements, and then exposed them through APIs on the local network. A new module 
                in the Magic Room management system invoke those APIs, elaborate the strenght signals, dynamically filter the results and offer them as 
                aggregated measures to the games.

              <p>
                My role was double. On one side I was in charge of developing the integration middleware to include the Sensorized CLimbing Wall
                sensor network within the Magic Room architecture. To complete this part of the project I had to organize the work of some 
                colleagues to determine the modifications to the core system of the existing Sensorized Climbing Wall. On top, I had to coordinate the work 
                of a subteam dedicated to the definiton of the AI algoritm to improve the multiperson triangolation of the fullbody tracking 
                performed on edge computing approaches.

              </p>
              <p>
                The second role was developer and supervisor of the activities to be performed to showcase the integration of the systems. I have developed one activity 
                and supervised a Masther thesist while he developed another one. Finally I have created the control applciaitons for the field study in which we 
                measured the effect of the combination of climbing and multisensoriality on the social behaviors of the users. Resutls of the study are reported
                in a paper under revision.

                      to show the climber what lies behind the hold. The other player has to climb from the start point to the target without using any 
                      of the forbidden holds.
