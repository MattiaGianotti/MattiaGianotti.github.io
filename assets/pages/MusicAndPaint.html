        <p>
          Music & Paint is an innovative evolution of the Magic Room project, focused on generative content. The primary objective of this project is to promote 
          collaboration between individuals with moderate to severe learning disabilities and complex needs, particularly those on the autism spectrum.
          Additionally, the project aims to provide caregivers with an innovative tool to support their daily activities. Existing literature suggests that 
          music and painting therapies can foster social interaction for autistic individuals. However, these tools often lack flexibility and struggle to 
          maintain attention. Furthermore, the combined effects of these approaches are still not fully understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we developed an initial prototype using the Magic Room tools, and subsequently created a portable version of the smart space. 
          This portable version was designed to make the tool accessible in contexts where it wasn't feasible to establish a dedicated room.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2023 - 2024</p>

            In Music & Paint, my role as Supervisor was to ensure the development adhered to a clean and user-centered design, focused on meeting the specific 
            needs of the users. Additionally, I provided technical expertise to address and solve the more complex challenges that arose during the development process.

            <div class="description">
              <p>
                In our application, we used a shared front-facing projection as a digital canvas, allowing two users to play simultaneously. Each user is equipped 
                with a handheld controller that enables them to paint, erase, or move elements on the canvas while interacting with different melodies. Players can 
                engage with the system by clicking on the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled controller or by moving around the space. The players can also share their 
                creations by combining their drawings or playing each other's melodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system also includes a hint system designed to support users when needed. It silently detects the users' behaviors, identifying repetitive patterns 
                of actions or activities. Based on these observations, it proposes visual and auditory stimuli to suggest new actions, inspire different interactions, 
                or draw attention to the other player's drawing. Additionally, the caregiver can use a tablet to control the experience, assisting users by cleaning up
                the drawings, changing drawing colors, or triggering specific actions through the hint system.
              </p>

                Each visual element is paired with a corresponding music counterpart, creating a harmonious balance of structure, predictability, and creativity 
                in the final outcome. This approach allows users to predict the results of their actions, which is especially important for autistic individuals, 
                as it provides a sense of organization and control.

          <p>
            Your role in the project was multi-faceted and crucial to its success. Initially, you acted as a cultural mediator, bridging the communication between 
            the international team members, caregivers, and final users who faced challenges speaking in English. This role was key in ensuring a smooth iterative 
            design process that took into account the needs of all stakeholders.
            Additionally, you served as the technological expert, interpreting requirements and evaluating the feasibility of the proposed approaches. You provided 
            valuable insights into how the technical solutions could meet the project goals while considering constraints and opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in the project, you became the technical supervisor, offering support during critical development moments. Your expertise was essential in guiding 
            the team through complex technical challenges. As the experimental design supervisor, you ensured the robustness of the study protocol and its feasibility,
            ensuring the experimental design was sound and well-executed. The results of the study are being prepared for publication in a scientific paper under 
            revision.
