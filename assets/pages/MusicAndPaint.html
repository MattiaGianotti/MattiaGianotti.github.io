        <p>
          Music & Paint is an <b>innovative evolution of the Magic Room project</b>, focused on <b>generative content</b>. The primary objective of this project is to 
          <b>promote collaboration</b> between individuals with moderate to severe learning disabilities and complex needs, particularly those on the <b>autism spectrum</b>.
          Additionally, the project aims to provide caregivers with an innovative tool to support their daily activities. Existing literature suggests that 
          music and painting therapies can <b>foster social interaction</b> for autistic individuals. However, these tools often lack flexibility and struggle to 
          maintain attention. Furthermore, the combined effects of these approaches are still not fully understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we developed an initial prototype using the Magic Room tools, and subsequently <b>created a portable version</b> of the smart space. 
          This portable version was designed to make the tool accessible in contexts where it wasn't feasible to establish a dedicated room.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2023 - 2024</p>

            In Music & Paint, my role as <b>Supervisor</b> was to ensure the development adhered to a clean and user-centered design, focused on meeting the specific 
            needs of the users. Additionally, I provided technical expertise to address and solve the more complex challenges that arose during the development process.

            <div class="subtitle">The Experience</div>
            <div class="description">
              <p>
                In our application, we used a shared front-facing projection as a digital canvas, allowing two users <b>to play simultaneously</b>. Each user is equipped 
                with a <b>handheld Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled controller</b> that enables them to paint, erase, or move elements on the canvas while interacting 
                with different melodies. Players can  engage with the system by clicking on the controller or by moving around the space. The players can also <b>share 
                their creations</b> by combining their drawings or playing each other's melodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system also includes a <b>hint system</b> designed to support users when needed. It silently <b>detects the users' behaviors</b>, identifying repetitive patterns 
                of actions or activities. Based on these observations, it <b>proposes visual and auditory stimuli</b> to suggest new actions, inspire different interactions, 
                or draw attention to the other player's drawing. Additionally, the caregiver can use a tablet to control the experience, assisting users by cleaning up
                the drawings, changing drawing colors, or triggering specific actions through the hint system.
              </p>

                Each visual element is paired with <b>a corresponding</b> music counterpart, creating a harmonious balance of structure, predictability, and creativity 
                in the final outcome. This approach allows users <b>to predict the results</b> of their actions, which is especially important for autistic individuals, 
                as it provides a sense of organization and control.

                      <li>Temporary melodies (created by quick movements on the canvas).</li>
                      <li>Normal melodies (created by slower movements).</li>

          <p>
            Initially, I  acted as a <b>cultural mediator</b>, bridging the communication between 
            the international team members, caregivers, and final users who faced challenges speaking in English. This role was key in ensuring a <b>smooth iterative 
            design process</b> that took into account the needs of all stakeholders. Additionally, I served as the technological expert, <b>interpreting requirements 
            and evaluating the feasibility</b> of the proposed approaches. I provided valuable insights into how the technical solutions could meet the project
            goals while <b>considering constraints and opportunities</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in the project, I took the role of the technical supervisor, offering <b>support during critical development moments</b>. Finally, as the <b>
            experimental design supervisor</b>, you ensured the robustness of the study protocol and its feasibility, ensuring the experimental design was sound 
            and well-executed. The results of the study are being prepared for publication in a scientific paper under revision.
