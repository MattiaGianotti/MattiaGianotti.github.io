        <p>
          Music & Paint is an innovative evolution of the Magic Room project focused on generative content.
          The first objectve of the project is aims to foster collaboration between people with moderate to 
          severe learning disabilities and complex needs, and in particular autism.
          Secondly, our aim was to offer caregivers an innovative possible tool during their daily activities.          
          It si known from litterature that painting and music therapy approaches can help to foster social 
          interaction for autistic people. However, the tools sometimes lack of flexibility and fail to keep 
          people's attention. Unknowns also remain about the effect of combining these approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project we created an initial prototype usign the Magic Room tools, then we created a 
          portable version of the smart space to bring the tool in contexts that could not create a dedicated
          room.
        </p>
        <p>Timeframe of the project: 2023 - 2024</p>

            In Music & Paint, my role as supervisor was to ensure the development followed a clean design directed
            to satisfy the users needs, together with offering technical knowledge to solve most complex problems.

            <div class="description">
              <p>
                In our applicatin we used a shared frontal projection as a digital canvas for two users playing simultaneously.
                Each user has a handheld controller that allows them to paint, errase or move around the canvas to play the
                different melodies. Users can ineract with the system by clicking on the Internet of Thins (IoT) powered contoller 
                or moving around the space. Players can share their melodies and drawings, either by combinig their drawings or 
                playing eachothers melodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system also include a hint system to support the users in case of need. It silently detect the different users 
                behaviours searching for repetive patters of actions or inctivities and propose visual and auditory stimuly
                to suggest the user different actions, inspire a new interaction or attract the attention to the other player's drawing.
                Finally the caregiver can  use the tablet to control the experience and help the users clean up the drawing, changing
                drawing color for the users, and force the hint system to triger a certain action.
              </p>

                Further detail on the design process can be found in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3613905.3651101" target="_blank">this scientific paper.</a>

                Each visual has a music counterpart and conversely in order to provide organization, strucure, predicibility and 
                armony to the final outcome; in this way the user can use its creativity to create whatever he desired predicting
                the outcome of its actions (fundamental for autistic people).

                  <li>Melodies are represented as lines eventually passing over the paint spots</li>
                  <li>composition rules differentate between temporary melodies (create by moving fast on the canvas), 
                    normal melodies(created by moving slowly), or loops (melodied hat forms a close shape) </li>

              <p>
                My role was of supervisor of the project. Initially I was in charge of the support of the design. My role was on on side the cultural mediator between 
                the team members (non italian) and the caregivers participating in the project and the final users involved in or iterative design approach who
                had difficulties speaking in english. On the other side I was also the technological expert that was asked to interpret the requirement and evaluae the
                feasibility of the propoesed approaches.

              </p>
              <p>
                In the following part of the project I was involved as technical supervisor to support the development in the critical moments, and especially as 
                experiemtal design supervisor, where my role was to check the soundness of the protocol and the feasibility.
                results of the study are reported in a scientific paper under revision.
